## Collaboration

NoteIt allows users to collaborate on shared notes in real time. Multiple users can simultaneously edit and view updates to the same note, enabling seamless teamwork and idea sharing.

## Security

User data and personal notes are secured through user authentication and authorization features. Passwords are hashed and encrypted to ensure data privacy and protect against unauthorized access.

## Performance

NoteIt is optimized for performance by minimizing render and loading times. Lazy loading techniques efficiently load notes and resources as users interact with the app. Code splitting and bundling techniques optimize the size of the frontend application for faster loading.

## Testing and Debugging

Unit tests have been written to ensure the reliability and stability of the frontend code. Continuous testing and debugging are conducted to identify and fix any UI-related issues or inconsistencies.

## Documentation

Documentation for NoteIt includes implementation decisions, chosen libraries, frameworks, and design patterns used in the frontend application. A user guide provides clear and concise instructions on how to navigate and utilize the app's features.
